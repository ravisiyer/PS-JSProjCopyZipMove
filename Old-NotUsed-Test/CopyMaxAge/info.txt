From https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy

To move files and subdirectories, excluding empty directories, from the "Records" folder to the "Backup" folder on drive "D", and exclude files older than 7 days, type the following:

Windows Command Prompt

Copy
robocopy C:\Users\Admin\Records D:\Backup /S /MAXAGE:7 /MOV /LOG:C:\Logs\Backup.log
----

We need copy and so MOV can be dropped (and LOG can be dropped).
robocopy C:\Users\Admin\Records D:\Backup /S /MAXAGE:7
