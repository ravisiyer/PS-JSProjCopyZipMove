To run shortcuts of PS script files (e.g. godark.ps1) with above commands (1 command in 1 script), I modified Target Shortcut property to "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -file D:\Users\Ravi-user\cmds\godark.ps1" for godark.ps1 script. [I only typed in: powershell.exe -file D:\Users\Ravi-user\cmds\godark.ps1 in the dialog. I think Windows expanded it automatically.]

Got icons8-dark-theme-30.png and icons8-light-mode-78.png free icons from https://icons8.com/ . Converted them to Windows icons icons8-dark-theme-30.ico and icons8-light-mode-78.ico for free using https://www.zamzar.com/convert/png-to-ico/

Associated icons with the shortcuts.

Then I dragged the shortcuts to taskbar which provided me option to pin them to taskbar which I did. 

Now I have two icons in taskbar which I can click to go to light mode or dark mode.
