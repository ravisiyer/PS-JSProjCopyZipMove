Powershell scripts mainly for copying and listing software development project source code folders and files
===========

Run or view MyPSScripts.ps1 in root folder of the repo to get a quick overview of the main scripts.

While the scripts were written primarily to help me do copying and listing of software development project (MERN stack, React Native and Android)
source code folders and files, it does help for other folders and files too.
