robocopy MAXAGE as number of days has max. value of 1899
Providing 1900 or higher number results in error.
This article too says same: Robocopy Maxage limitations,
 https://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/28547227/Robocopy-Maxage-limitations.html but further explains 
 robocopy doc, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy,
 for /minlad:<n> spec. of 
 "If n is less than 1900, n specifies the number of days. Otherwise, n specifies a date in the format YYYYMMDD."
  applies to earlier 3 entries including /maxage.

I tried specifying relative sub-path to robocopy once again and faced the same failures as logged in 16-17 Feb. 2025 note below. But I also tried absolute path and that worked. 
...
\app\build exclusion simply does not work in robocopy except if full path is specified which the script cannot do.

As a limited workaround, consider using intermediates by default and provide build being excluded as an optional parameter.

=========
In CopyWoNmNxbld, need to figure out how to exclude build only from Android projects as build in Tailwind seems to be reqd. to copy.

Below article/post tips did not work for me!

https://serverfault.com/questions/304896/wildcard-directory-exclusions-with-robocopy-weird-case

Part of the failure is using a trailing \ in Robocopy when referring to a directory - which is a no-no - as Robocopy tries to interpret it as an escape character. Almost everyone makes this mistake in one way or another with Robocopy. With that in mind, this example will work:

/XD "\Bar"
If you wanted to match a more specific folder structure (so as not to match other subfolders, you can add more detail, like:

/XD "\Foo\Bar"
/XD "C:\Foo\Bar"

..........
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67922726/how-to-exclude-subfolders-with-specific-titles-from-robocopy-in-cmd
Alternatively, if applicable: /XD _* to exclude all directorys beginning with an underscore. The /XD switch excludes the directory if appearing on any level of subdirectories. Wildcards like * and ? are supported. If the name contains spaces, quote the names like /XD "My Folder" "Data\Folder 2" etc.

Tests done in C:\Users\ravi-user\Projects\PS-Scripts\Copywonmnx\Test

Below cmd works ... excludes app directory ... so there is no type issue here for app\build ... it just does not work
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next app .gradle

Below cmd works but excludes all build not only app\build
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next build .gradle

Below cmd gave ERROR : Invalid Parameter #7 : "*app\\build*"
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next *app\\build* .gradle

Below cmd did not work
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next app\\build .gradle

Below cmd did not work
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next "app/build" .gradle

Below cmd did not work
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next "app\build" .gradle

Below cmd did not work
robocopy Test1 Test1-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next "\app\build" .gradle

16 Feb. 2025: Updated script to exclude Android build and .gradle folders. Also changed output folder extension suitably. Also modified script name slightly.

below works ... build directory is skipped in copy.
robocopy LaunchTimestamp LaunchTimestamp-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next build .gradle

below does not work and build directory gets copied over.
robocopy LaunchTimestamp LaunchTimestamp-wo-nmnxbld /E /XD node_modules .next "app\build" .gradle

10 Jun. 2024: Key info. from this file has been put up on my blog post: Windows Powershell scripts: Copy without node_modules and .next folders/directories; List node_modules and .next folders, https://raviswdev.blogspot.com/2024/06/windows-powershell-scripts-copy-without.html .

============================

Reference: https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sysadmin/powershell/how-to-use-parameters-in-powershell/ 

Info. on Param: In section "Param", https://ss64.com/ps/syntax-args.html . From the article:
To define arguments by name, use a param statement, which is a comma separated list of variables, optionally prefixed with a [data type] and/or with = default values.

If used, the param statement MUST be the first thing in your script or function:

param (
   [string]$welcome
)
Then call the script/function like:

mysuperfunction -welcome "Hello world"
A more complex example with multiple parameters, separated with commmas and some default values:

param (
   [string]$welcome, 
   [string]$ComputerName = $env:computername,    
   [string]$username = $(throw "-username is required."),
   [string]$password = $( Read-Host -asSecureString "Input password" ),
   [switch]$SaveData = $false
)
Write-Output "The price is $price"
Write-Output "The Computer Name is $ComputerName"
Write-Output "The True/False switch argument is $SaveData"

Calling this script, and setting the switch parameter -SaveData to $TRUE:
.\demo.ps1 -ComputerName "\\server64" -SaveData

or setting -SaveData to $FALSE:
.\demo.ps1 -ComputerName "\\server64" -SaveData:$false
--- end extract ---

I could not locate a Param reference page in limited net search. So the above article is very useful.

From https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-n-in-powershell :
`n is used in Powershell to append a new line to the standard output.

The use of `n in Powershell is similar to \n in C++ or Java.

-------------------------------

Use Write-Host or Write-Output in copywonmnx.ps1 script?
I think Write-Host should be used as the script is simply an interactive front-end to the robocopy command that is executed if user chooses to proceed. If Write-Host is used then redirecting output to log.txt file by '.\copywonmnx.ps1 .\Test\ > log.txt' results in copywonmnx script interactions to be seen on console as is appropriate, and only robocopy output is redirected to log.txt. If Write-Output is used then only $host.UI.PromptForChoice data is shown on console, which I feel is too limited. So I have decided to stick to using Write-Host in copywonmnx.ps1 script.
