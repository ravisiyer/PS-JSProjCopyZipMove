Done: 3) Invocation of ExcludeDirsRecurseListFilesDirs.ps1 can be parameterized through the ListAllFF.ps1 script or a variant.
4) Consider using write-host in ExcludeDirsRecurseListFilesDirs.ps1 to print Excluded directories if that can work.
 Note that using write-output interferes with it
 being used together with (sort-of piped to) other PowerShell stuff like is used in ListMaxAgeFF.
5) ListAllFF should be renamed to indicate it excludes standard folders
   A new ListAllFF should be created 
1) Created CopyWoXfldr.ps1 instead ... Copywonmnxbld can be parameterized
-all - nm, nx, bld, intermediates, target, out
otherwise the directories to be skipped can be passed as parameters.

2) CopyWoXfldr.ps1 handles incremental backup too.

6) For CopyWoXfldr: If MaxAge is specified, /s is better option than /e
    But if it is a full fresh copy /e may be better.
1) Add ExcludeFolders parm to CopyWoXFMaxAge

My blog posts mentioned below have some useful info. about some of the scripts in this folder (and subfolders):
1) Windows PowerShell script and commands to list files and folders modified in past x days excluding specified folders like .git and node_modules, https://raviswdev.blogspot.com/2024/05/windows-powershell-script-list-files.html

2) Windows Powershell scripts: Copy without node_modules and .next folders/directories; List node_modules and .next folders, https://raviswdev.blogspot.com/2024/06/windows-powershell-scripts-copy-without.html .
